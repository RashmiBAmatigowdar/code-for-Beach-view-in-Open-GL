# code-for-Beach-view-in-Open-GL
It is a 2-dimensional project where we have drawn the scene of Beach with the user interaction when the user will press 'd' or 'D' we can view the day view of beach and on pressing 'e' or 'E' we can view the evening scene. There is a movement of boat and birds in this project.
